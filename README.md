# AI_Search Algorithm
Search algorithms are essential in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science, helping systems find solutions efficiently in complex problem spaces. They explore possible paths or states to reach a goal, playing a key role in applications like pathfinding, decision-making, and optimization. Without them, AI would struggle to process large datasets and make intelligent choices. There are different types of search algorithms: uninformed search explores blindly, informed search uses heuristics to improve efficiency, and local search optimizes solutions iteratively. These algorithms enable AI to solve problems effectively, making them a fundamental part of modern technology.
